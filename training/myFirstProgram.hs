-- 2. My first program

-- Function definition syntax 

-- BASIC SYNTAX: function name followed by argument names, then an equal sign and an expression. 
-- Example1: functionName param1 = param1 * 2 
-- Example2: square x = x*x
-- Note: Functions and variable names always start with lowercase letters. 



-- The main function 
-- The program needs a main function to run. Where the execution starts and ends.

pyth a b = a * a + b * b 



-- Function definition is equation. Meaning the left hand side is equal to the right hand side. 



-- Pattern matching 

tuple1 = (1,3)

pythTuple (a,b) = a * a + b * b 

getThePoint (a, (x,y), str) = (x,y)


-- Wild card, the '_' symbol acts like a wild card. It matches anything and discards it. 

getThePointv2 (_ , pt, _ ) = pt
